# Welcome to Idyll

This is an Idyll file. Write text 
as you please in here. To add interactivity, 
you can add  different components to the text.

Here is how you can use a variable:

[var name:"exampleVar" value:5 /]

[Range min:0 max:10 value:exampleVar /]
[DisplayVar var:exampleVar /]

```
var code = true;
```

And here is a custom component:

[CustomComponent /]

You can use standard html tags if a
component with the same name 
doesn't exist.

[img src:"images/idyll.png" /]
